# Kaggle-Corp-Favorita-Sales-Forecasting
This repository contains code that I created for Corporación Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting Kaggle competition. 
Corporación Favorita challenged the Kaggle community to build a model that more accurately forecasts product sales. They currently rely on subjective forecasting methods with very little data to back them up and very little automation to execute plans. They’re excited to see how machine learning could better ensure they please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.

I ended in top 4% in this competition.
